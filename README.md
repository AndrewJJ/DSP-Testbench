# DSP Testbench

A testbench for DSP routines for developers using the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com)


DSP Testbench is designed to help you analyse your DSP by providing a test harness for code inheriting from `juce::dsp::ProcessorBase`. The harness provides signal sources, routing, analysis and monitoring functions.
